For this lab you will use multivariate auto-regressive state-space (MARSS) to analyze multivariate salmon data from the Columbia River. These data are noisy and gappy. They are estimates of total spawner abundance and might include hatchery spawners.

## Teams

1.  Lower Columbia River Chinook: Zoe Rand (QERM), Emma Timmins-Schiffman (Genome Sci), Maria Kuruvilla (QERM)
2.  Lower Columbia River Steelhead: Eric French (Civil), Liz Elmstrom (SAFS), Terrance Wang (SAFS)
3.  Lower Columbia River Coho: Nick Chambers (SAFS), Karl Veggerby (SAFS), Miranda Mudge (Molecular & Cellular)
4.  Middle Columbia River Steelhead: Madison Shipley (SAFS), Dylan Hubl (Env & Forest Sci)

## Lower Columbia River salmon spawner data

These data are from the [Coordinated Assessments Partnership (CAP)](https://www.streamnet.org/cap/about-cap/) and downloaded using the [rCAX R client](https://nwfsc-math-bio.github.io/rCAX/) for the CAX (the CAP database) API. The data are saved in `Lab-2/Data_Images/columbia-river.rda`.

```{r}
load(here::here("Lab-2", "Data_Images", "columbia-river.rda"))
```

The data set has data for fi endangered and threatened ESU (Evolutionary Significant Units) in the Lower Columbia River.

```{r}
esu <- unique(columbia.river$esu_dps)
esu
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.cap="Figure from ESA recovery plan for Lower Columbia River Coho salmon, Lower Columbia River Chinook salmon, Columbia River Chum salmon, and Lower Columbia River steelhead. 2013. NMFS NW Region.  https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/16002"}
knitr::include_graphics("Data_Images/LCR-chinook-regions.png")
```

### Data structure

The dataset has the following columns

```{r}
colnames(columbia.river)
```

-   species: Chinook, Coho, Steelhead
-   esu_dps: name of the ESU
-   majorpopgroup: biological major group
-   commonpopname: common population name, generally a stream or river
-   run: run-timing
-   spawningyear: the year that the spawners were counted on the spawning grounds
-   value: total (natural-born and hatchery-born) spawners on the spawning ground. Generally some type of redd-count expansion or some other stream count of spawners. Redd = a gravel nest.

### Data plots

Let's load one ESU and make a plot. Create a function.

```{r}
plotesu <- function(esuname){
  df <- columbia.river %>% subset(esu_dps %in% esuname)
ggplot(df, aes(x=spawningyear, y=log(value), color=majorpopgroup)) + 
  geom_point(size=0.2, na.rm = TRUE) + 
  theme(strip.text.x = element_text(size = 3)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 5, angle = 90)) +
  facet_wrap(~esapopname) +
  ggtitle(paste0(esuname, collapse="\n"))
}
```



```{r}
plotesu(esu[4])
```


```{r}
df <- columbia.river %>% subset(species == "Coho salmon")
ggplot(df, aes(x=spawningyear, y=log(value), color=run)) + 
  geom_point(size=0.2, na.rm = TRUE) +
  theme(strip.text.x = element_text(size = 3)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 5, angle = 90)) + 
  facet_wrap(~esapopname)
```

## Tasks for each group

1.  Create estimates of spawner abundance for all missing years and provide estimates of the decline from the historical abundance.

2.  Evaluate support for the major population groups. Are the populations in the groups more correlated than outside the groups?

3.  Evaluate the evidence of cycling in the data. *We will talk about how to do this on the Tuesday after lab.*

### Tips

**Simplify**

If your ESU has many populations, start with a smaller set of 4-7 populations.

**Assumptions**

You can assume that `R="diagonal and equal"` and `A="scaling"`. Assume that "historical" means the earliest years available for your group.

**States**

Your abundance estimate is the "x" or "state" estimates. You can get this from

```         
fit$states
```
```{r}
fit$states
```

or

```         
tsSmooth(fit)
```

where `fit` is from `fit <- MARSS()`

**plotting**

Estimate of the mean of the spawner counts based on your x model.

```         
autoplot(fit, plot.type="fitted.ytT")
```

**diagnostics**

```         
autoplot(fit, plot.type="residuals")
```

### Address the following in your methods

-   Describe your assumptions about the x and how the data time series are related to x.

    -   How are the x and y (data) related? 1 x for 1 y or will you assume 1 x for all y or 1 x for each major population group? How will you choose?
    -   What will you assume about the U for the x's?
    -   What will you assume about the Q matrix?

-   Write out your assumptions as different models **in matrix form**, fit each and then compare these with AIC or AICc.

-   Do your estimates differ depending on the assumptions you make about the structure of the data, i.e. you assumptions about the x's, Q, and U.

## Sample code

Here I show how I might analyze the Upper Columbia Steelhead data.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.cap="Figure from 2022 5-Year Review: Summary & Evaluation of Upper Columbia River Spring-run Chinook Salmon and Upper Columbia River Steelhead. NMFS. West Coast Region. https://doi.org/10.25923/p4w5-dp31"}
knitr::include_graphics("Data_Images/UCR-Steelhead-regions.png")
```

Set up the data. We need the time series in a matrix with time across the columns.

Load the data.

```{r}
load(here::here("Lab-2", "Data_Images", "columbia-river.rda"))
```

Wrangle the data.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
esuname <- esu[4]

dat <- columbia.river %>% 
  subset(esu_dps == esuname) %>% # get only this ESU
  mutate(log.spawner = log(value)) %>% # create a column called log.spawner
  select(esapopname, spawningyear, log.spawner) %>% # get just the columns that I need
  pivot_wider(names_from = "esapopname", values_from = "log.spawner") %>% 
  column_to_rownames(var = "spawningyear") %>% # make the years rownames
  as.matrix() %>% # turn into a matrix with year down the rows
  t() # make time across the columns
# MARSS complains if I don't do this
dat[is.na(dat)] <- NA
```

Clean up the row names

```{r}
tmp <- rownames(dat)
tmp <- stringr::str_replace(tmp, "Salmon, coho [(]Lower Columbia River ESU[)]", "")
tmp <- stringr::str_trim(tmp)
rownames(dat) <- tmp
```

Select a subset of rivers to test

```{r}
mod_rivers <- c("Sandy River - early and late", 
           "Grays and Chinook Rivers - late", 
           "Clatskanie River - late", 
           "Lower Gorge Tributaries - late", 
           "Tilton River - early and late", 
           "Oregon Upper Gorge Tributaries and Hood River - early")

sub_dat <- dat[rownames(dat) %in% mod_rivers, ] 
```

Specify a model

```{r}
mod.list1 <- list(
  U = "unequal",
  R = "diagonal and equal",
  Q = "unconstrained"
)

mod.list2 <- list(
  U = "equal",
  R = "diagonal and equal",
  Q = "unconstrained"
)


mod.list3 <- list(B = matrix(1), 
                   U = matrix("u"), 
                   Q = matrix("q"), # 1 X
                   Z = matrix(1, 6, 1), 
                   A = "scaling", 
                   R = "diagonal and unequal", # single column of 1s for Y
                   x0 = matrix("mu"), 
                   tinitx = 0)

mod.list4 <- list(B = diag(1,6), 
                  U = matrix("u",6,1), 
                  Q = "diagonal and unequal", 
                  Z = diag(1,6), 
                  A = "scaling", 
                  R = "diagonal and equal", 
                  x0 = "unequal", 
                  tinitx = 0)

# Best model! 
mod.list5 <- list(
  U = "unequal",
  R = "diagonal and equal",
  Q = "equalvarcov"
)
```

Fit the model. In this case, a BFGS algorithm is faster.

```{r}
library(MARSS)
fit1 <- MARSS(sub_dat, model=mod.list1, method="BFGS")
fit2 <- MARSS(sub_dat, model=mod.list2, method="BFGS")
fit3 <- MARSS(sub_dat, model=mod.list3)
fit4 <- MARSS(sub_dat, model=mod.list4)
fit5 <- MARSS(sub_dat, model=mod.list5, control = list(maxit=1000))

```

Plot fits

```{r}
plot.mod1 <- autoplot(fit1, plot.type="fitted.ytT")
plot.mod2 <- autoplot(fit2, plot.type="fitted.ytT")
plot.mod3 <- autoplot(fit3, plot.type="fitted.ytT")
plot.mod4 <- autoplot(fit4, plot.type = "fitted.ytT")
plot.mod5 <- autoplot(fit5, plot.type="fitted.ytT")
```

Evaluate correlation between regions

```{r}
# change fit# to evaluate correlation between regions in different models 

library(corrplot)
Q <- coef(fit1, type="matrix")$Q
corrmat <- diag(1/sqrt(diag(Q))) %*% Q %*% diag(1/sqrt(diag(Q)))
corrplot(corrmat)

```

AICc 

```{r}
aic <- c(fit1$AICc, fit2$AICc, fit3$AICc, fit4$AICc, fit5$AICc)
aic-min(aic) #delta AICc 
```

A comparison of delta AICc indicates that model 3 is the best fit for the data. There are no other models within delta AICc of 2.0 or less. There are two alternative models within delta AICc of 5.0, but no compelling reason to use those over the cearly top model. Model 3 was the best out of the five models tested, so we'll use that one to estimate historical abundances. This is not to say that model 3 is the best model possible for this data, only that it's the best model out of the 5 that we compared. 





Evaluating fit of states by looking at plots and residuals

```{r}
fit3$states
tsSmooth(fit3)
autoplot(fit3, plot.type="fitted.ytT")
autoplot(fit3, plot.type="residuals")
```


### Including cycling

Let's just look at the data after 1987 to eliminate that string of NAs in the 3 rivers.

```{r}
sub_dat <- sub_dat[,colnames(sub_dat)>1987]
```

Let's look the acf to look for evidence of cycling. Due to the nature of their life-cycle where they tend to return back to their spawning grounds after a certain numbers of years, we might expect some cycling although steelhead aren't really known for this (unlike sockeye, chinook and pink).

Well no obvious cycles.

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
for(i in 1:4){
  acf(sub_dat[i,], na.action=na.pass, main=rownames(sub_dat)[i])
}
```

But let's go through how we might include cycles. We are going to include cycles with frequency 3, 4, and 5, choosem to reflect steelhead returning after 3, 4 or 5 years.

```{r}
TT <- dim(sub_dat)[2] #number of time steps
covariates <- rbind(
  forecast::fourier(ts(1:TT, freq=3), K=1) |> t(),
  forecast::fourier(ts(1:TT, freq=4), K=1) |> t(),
  forecast::fourier(ts(1:TT, freq=5), K=1) |> t()
)
```

Now let's fit a model with these covariates. Let's analyze the populations separately, so Q is diagonal.
```{r}
mod.list6 <- list(
  Q = "unconstrained",
  U = "unequal",
  R = "diagonal and equal",
  D = "unconstrained",
  d = covariates
)
```
  
```{r acf-entiat}
fit6 <- MARSS(sub_dat, model=mod.list6)
```

Let's plot the estimates. `broom::tidy()` will get a data frame with the terms, estimates and CIs.
```{r}
library(broom)
sub_dat <- tidy(fit6) %>%
  subset(stringr::str_sub(term,1,1)=="D")
sub_dat$lag <- as.factor(rep(3:5, each=8))
sub_dat$river <- as.factor(rep(rownames(sub_dat),3))
sub_dat$sc <- rep(rep(c("S","C"), each=4), 3)
sub_dat$type <- paste0(sub_dat$sc,sub_dat$lag)
```

We can then plot this. Interesting. Some support for 5 year cycles.
```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x=type, y=estimate, col=lag)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=conf.low, ymax=conf.up), width=.2, position=position_dodge(.9)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  facet_wrap(~river) +
  ggtitle("The cycle estimates with CIs")
```

Let's compare some other models.
```{r}
# No cycles
mod.list <- list(
  Q = "unconstrained",
  U = "unequal",
  R = "diagonal and equal"
)
fit1.87 <- MARSS(sub_dat, model=mod.list, silent=TRUE)
# Only lag 5 cycles
mod.list <- list(
  Q = "unconstrained",
  U = "unequal",
  R = "diagonal and equal",
  D = "unconstrained",
  d = covariates[5:6,]
)
fit5.87 <- MARSS(sub_dat, model=mod.list, silent=TRUE)
# Cycles in the process
# which doesn't really make sense for salmon since the cycles are age-structure cycles 
# which act like cycles in the observations
mod.list <- list(
  Q = "unconstrained",
  U = "unequal",
  R = "diagonal and equal",
  C = "unconstrained",
  c = covariates
)
fit6.87 <- MARSS(sub_dat, model=mod.list, silent=TRUE)
```

Hmm model without cyles is much better (lower AICc). Even if we only have the 5 year cycles (`covariates[5:6,]`), the AICc is larger than for the models with cycles.
```{r}
aic <- c(fit1.87$AICc, fit4.87$AICc, fit5.87$AICc, fit6.87$AICc)
aic-min(aic)
```



Predict historical data for all regions and fit best models

```{r}
# use best model (5) to fit full dataset
fit_full <- MARSS(dat, model=mod.list5, control = list(maxit=1000))

#fit to full dataset
autoplot(fit_full, plot.type = "fitted.ytT")
```
