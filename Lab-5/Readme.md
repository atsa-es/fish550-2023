# Getting Started

* Read over the background material on DFA [here](https://atsa-es.github.io/atsa/Labs/Week%204/intro-to-dfa.html)

* Do a pull of the `fish550-2023` repository so you have the most updated version.

* Copy [Lab-3-template](https://github.com/atsa-es/fish550-2023/tree/main/Lab-3) into your team folder.


# Collaborating on your write-up

* Each team has a Team folder in the Lab folder. Each person can have a file there and you can assemble the work together at the end. One person will need to push that to your teams GitHub folder (Lab-3/Final_Write_ups) at the end.

* GitHub too frustrating? You can share a Google Drive/Dropbox etc folder and edit there. However it is harder for you to get input from the instructors and your classmates if you do that.

* Git Flow: You can also have one main team file in the team folder on GitHub. Everyone works on branches of the team file. When you want to merge a change in, put in a pull request and merges that in. You can use the review feature to get team input before merging.
