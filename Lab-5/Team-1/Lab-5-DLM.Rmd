## Background {#sec-dlm-homework}

For the lab this week we will use DLM's to examine some of the time-varying properties of the spawner-recruit relationship for Pacific salmon. Much work has been done on this topic, particularly by Randall Peterman and his students and post-docs at Simon Fraser University. To do so, researchers commonly use a Ricker model because of its relatively simple form, such that the number of recruits (offspring) born in year $t$ ($R_t$) from the number of spawners (parents) ($S_t$) is

\begin{equation}
R_t = a S_t e^{-b S + v_t}.
\end{equation}


The parameter $a$ determines the maximum reproductive rate in the absence of any density-dependent effects (the slope of the curve at the origin), $b$ is the strength of density dependence, and $v_t \sim N(0,\sigma)$. In practice, the model is typically log-transformed so as to make it linear with respect to the predictor variable $S_t$, such that

\begin{align}
\text{log}(R_t) &= \text{log}(a) + \text{log}(S_t) -b S_t + v_t \\
\text{log}(R_t) - \text{log}(S_t) &= \text{log}(a) -b S_t + v_t \\
\text{log}(R_t/S_t) &= \text{log}(a) - b S_t + v_t.
\end{align}


Substituting $y_t = \text{log}(R_t/S_t)$, $x_t = S_t$, and $\alpha = \text{log}(a)$ yields a simple linear regression model with intercept $\alpha$ and slope $b$.

Unfortunately, however, residuals from this simple model typically show high-autocorrelation due to common environmental conditions that affect overlapping generations. Therefore, to correct for this and allow for an index of stock productivity that controls for any density-dependent effects, the model may be re-written as

\begin{align}
\text{log}(R_t/S_t) &= \alpha_t - b S_t + v_t, \\
\alpha_t &= \alpha_{t-1} + w_t,
\end{align}

and $w_t \sim N(0,q)$. By treating the brood-year specific productivity as a random walk, we allow it to vary, but in an autocorrelated manner so that consecutive years are not independent from one another.

More recently, interest has grown in using covariates ($e.g.$, sea-surface temperature) to explain the interannual variability in productivity. In that case, we can can write the model as

\begin{equation}
\text{log}(R_t/S_t) = \alpha + \delta_t X_t - b S_t + v_t.
\end{equation}

In this case we are estimating some base-level productivity ($\alpha$) plus the time-varying effect of some covariate $X_t$ ($\delta_t$). 



### Spawner-recruit data {#sec-dlm-spawner-recruit-data}

The data come from a large public database begun by Ransom Myers many years ago. If you are interested, you can find lots of time series of spawning-stock, recruitment, and harvest for a variety of fishes around the globe. The website is [here](https://www.ramlegacy.org/).

For this exercise, we will use spawner-recruit data for sockeye salmon (_Oncorhynchus nerka_) from the Kvichak River in SW Alaska that span the years 1952-1989. In addition, we'll examine the potential effects of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) during the salmon's first year in the ocean, which is widely believed to be a "bottleneck" to survival.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/BB_sockeye_rivers_inset.png")
# ![](images/BB_sockeye_rivers_inset.png)
```


These data are in the **atsalibrary** package on GitHub. If needed, install using the **devtools** package.

```{r dlm-load-atsa, eval=FALSE}
## library(devtools)
## Windows users will likely need to set this
## Sys.setenv("R_REMOTES_NO_ERRORS_FROM_WARNINGS" = "true")
devtools::install_github("nwfsc-timeseries/atsalibrary")
```

Load the data.

```{r dlm-read-data}
data(KvichakSockeye, package="atsalibrary")
SR_data <- KvichakSockeye
```

The data are a dataframe with columns for brood year (`brood_year`), number of spawners (`spawners`), number of recruits (`recruits`) and PDO at year $t-2$ in summer (`pdo_summer_t2`) and in winter (`pdo_winter_t2`).

```{r dlm-data-head}
## head of data file
head(SR_data)
```
